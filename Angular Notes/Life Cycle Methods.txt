When Component is created some methods are automatically created

// Only class instance has been created
constructor() {
  //initializing properties
  // dependency injection
  // event listener
}

// Multiple times called or it is called whenever changes happen
ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
   console.log(changes);
}

// Component is ready at this point so values can be used in the component
ngOnInit() {
    console.log('ngOnInit called');
  }

// It is for cleaup ot Unregister Event listener
  ngOnDestroy() {
    console.log('ngOnDestroy is called');
  }
