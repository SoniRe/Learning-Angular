Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where the server generates the HTML content of a web page before it’s sent to the user’s browser. Let’s delve into the details:

What is Server Side Rendering?
-> SSR involves rendering your website’s HTML on the server itself.
-> Unlike Client Side Rendering (CSR), where the browser generates the HTML content after receiving 
   raw data from the server, SSR ensures that a fully rendered page is sent to the client.
