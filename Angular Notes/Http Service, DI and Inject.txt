Service - To make network request or making request to remote server we write out code in services
We can do authentication in Component also but thats not the recommended way

1) Make Network calls or API calls
2) Make Global varibales just like redux store

Example - User is doing auth which will do get request then it will be written in services

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})

// Provided in root means we can use anywhere in the program

http: HttpClient;
  constructor(http: HttpClient) {
    this.http = http;
  }

or

constructor(private http: HttpClient) {} // This syntax is dependency injection

or 

private http = inject(HttpClient);

// This line below returns an observalble
this.http.get('https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category=dev');


Subsribe is just like then

  getJoke() {
    this.http
      .get('https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category=dev')
      .subscribe((data) => {
        console.log(data);
      });
  }
