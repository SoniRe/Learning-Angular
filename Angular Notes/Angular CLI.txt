1) ng serve: This part initiates the development server. It compiles your Angular application 
   and hosts it locally so you can view it in a web browser. The server watches for changes in your 
   code and automatically rebuilds the application when you save any files.

2) -o or --open: This flag opens the application in your default web browser once the server is
   up and running. Itâ€™s a convenient way to immediately see your changes without manually navigating 
   to the local server URL.
